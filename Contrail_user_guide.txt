#########################################################################################

1. Clone the fresh contrail-installer repository from the git by using command below

    git clone https://github.com/shravani89/contrail-installer -b test-m1-build 

2. Copy the file localrc-all from samples directory to the current directory as localrc and 
   make sure that localrc file have the following changes 

To disable the binary installation and download, 
    CONTRAIL_DEFAULT_INSTALL=False 
    If binaries need to be downloaded and installed make above “True”

Branch that points to the changes made in scons directory
    CONTRAIL_BRANCH=test-m1-build 

To download the ALL dependencies, 
    INSTALL_PROFILE=ALL
    If only COMPUTE source code needs to be downloaded and installed, use “COMPUTE”.

To use screens,
    USE_SCREEN=True 

3. Build the contrail with all the required packages using the command

    ./contrail.sh build

4. To install contrail modules and its dependencies, run “./contrail.sh install “, which will Install 
   all the necessary Modules to start the contrail services 


5. Configure the contrail using “./contrail.sh configure” such that it makes the necessary changes in 
   the files in /etc/contrail which are used by the contrail services  

Files that are modified in configure phase are
    /etc/contrail/contrail-api.conf
    /etc/contrail/contrail_plugin.ini
    /etc/contrail/contrail-schema.conf
    /etc/contrail/svc-monitor.conf
    /etc/contrail/discovery.conf
    /etc/contrail/vnc_api_lib.ini
    /etc/contrail/ContrailPlugin.ini
    /etc/contrail/contrail-control.conf
    /etc/contrail/dns.conf
    /etc/contrail/contrail-compute.conf
    /etc/contrail/contrail-vrouter-agent.conf
    /etc/ifmap-server/basicauthusers.properties
    /etc/contrail/default_pmac
    /etc/contrail/ifcfg-vhost0
    /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
    /etc/contrail/ctrl-details
    /etc/contrail/contrail-collector.conf
    /etc/contrail/contrail-query-engine.conf
    /etc/contrail/contrail-analytics-api.conf

6. Start the contrail services using the command

    ./contrail.sh start

7. To stop the contrail services at any time use

    ./contrail.sh stop

8. Clean is enabled in this version so that we can run clean using

    ./contrail.sh clean

NOTE: Clean option should be run when all the contrail services are UP and Running

9. ‘setup_devstack.sh’ script will clone the specified devstack repository to the previous directory 
    from current working directory. Copies the localrc-multinode-server file from contrail-installer/samples 
    directory to the devstack directory as localrc.
    ‘contrail’ file is added to the devstack/lib/neutron_plugins/ directory from the current working directory.
    By default, localrc file will have all the changes required for the muiltiserver node.
    'contrail' file will act as an interface between the contrail and the openstack.

In 'stackrc', NEUTRON_REPO, NEUTRON_BRANCH variable values are changed and CONTRAIL_GIT_BASE variable 
is added in this script so that neutron repo points to the juniper neutron repo
    
    CONTRAIL_GIT_BASE=https://github.com/juniper 
    NEUTRON_REPO=contrail/havana
    NEUTRON_BRANCH=${CONTRAIL_GIT_BASE}/neutron.git

NOTE: Current working directory implies the directory where the repository contrail-installer is cloned.

10. 'service.sh' script is used to start, stop and restart the services if USE_SCREEN is False.
